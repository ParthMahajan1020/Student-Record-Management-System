# Student Record Management System (Java Console Application)

## Overview
The **Student Record Management System (SRMS)** is a Java console-based application designed to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records. It allows users to manage a dynamic list of students with unique IDs, names, and marks.  

This project demonstrates basic Java programming skills, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, and exception handling.
